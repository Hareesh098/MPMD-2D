MPMD-2D: Multi-Potential Molecular Dynamics Simulation Code

Overview

MPMD-2D is a Multi-Potential Molecular Dynamics (MPMD) simulation code developed for simulating 2D molecular systems. The code uses MPI-based parallelization, allowing efficient execution across multiple processors. The codebase is organized into different directories for ease of use, and the simulation can be configured and run with a few simple commands.

Directory Structure

The main directory structure of MPMD-2D is as follows:

MPMD-2D/
  |-- STATE
  |-- STATE-PARAMS
  |-- 2DLatticeGen.c
  |-- 2DLatticeGen (executable)
  |-- source/
       |-- main (executable)
       |-- input-data
       |-- Makefile
       |-- job file
  |-- output/

Main Directory (MPMD-2D)

STATE: Initial configuration file for the simulation. This file is generated by the 2DLatticeGen executable.

STATE-PARAMS: Parameter file containing system size, temperature, density, and other thermodynamic parameters.

2DLatticeGen.c: Source code to generate the initial lattice configuration.

2DLatticeGen: Executable to generate the initial configuration (STATE) based on the parameters in STATE-PARAMS.

Source Directory (source)

Contains the main simulation code and related files:

main: Executable file that runs the molecular dynamics simulation.

input-data: Input file providing simulation-specific data and settings.

Makefile: Used to compile the source code.

job file: File for managing job execution on a cluster or parallel environment.

Output Directory (output)

Stores all the output files generated during the simulation run. The output filenames are determined by the prefix argument provided when running the main executable.

How to Run the Code

Step 1: Generate Initial Configuration

In the top-level directory (MPMD-2D), generate the initial configuration by running the executable 2DLatticeGen:

./2DLatticeGen

This reads the parameters from STATE-PARAMS and produces the initial configuration file STATE.

Step 2: Run the Simulation

Navigate to the source directory:

cd source

To run the main simulation, use the following command:

mpirun -np #Np ./main #Prefix

#Np: Number of processors to use.

#Prefix: Prefix for the output filenames.

All output files will be saved in the ../output directory with the name specified by #Prefix.

Example Workflow

In the main directory (MPMD-2D), generate the initial configuration:

./2DLatticeGen

Move to the source directory:

cd source

Run the simulation with MPI:

mpirun -np 4 ./main sim_output

This will run the simulation using 4 processors, and the output files will be saved in the output directory with the prefix sim_output.

Output

All output files (simulation data, logs, etc.) will be saved in the output directory with the specified prefix for easy identification and post-processing.

Notes

Make sure MPI is installed on your system to use the mpirun command.

The Makefile in the source directory can be used to compile the source code if modifications are made.

Ensure that all paths and filenames are correctly specified to avoid any runtime errors.
